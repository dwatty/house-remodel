Today was move-in day.  We signed papers yesterday and are getting started today.  We had hoped to have a fence going up by now, but that's not happening since our fence people 'had a cmmercial job go long.'  A likely story.

So Dex and I got started bright and early hauling stuff from storage unit to garage.  Lots of fun was had, but few pictures were taken.  I did manage to ge a picture of a cat that decided to hang out.  So, free cat.
