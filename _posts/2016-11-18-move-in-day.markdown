Today was move-in day.  We signed papers yesterday and are getting started today.  We had hoped to have a fence going up by now, but that's not happening since our fence people 'had a cmmercial job go long.'  A likely story.

So Dex and I got started bright and early hauling stuff from storage unit to garage.  While he was excited to see all his stuff again, that excitement soured when we realized he couldn't play with anything yet.

Lots of fun was had, but few pictures were taken.  We made a friend while we were unloading the first trailer load of stuff from our unit.

That cat decided to hang around most of the day and showed several times over the next couple of days.  Soo, free cat.
